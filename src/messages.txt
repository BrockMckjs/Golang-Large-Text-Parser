In the biblical story of Babel, the people of Babel set out to build a tower toconfront God in heaven. Sharing one language allowed them to communicateperfectly and move along with the construction of their tower. But God put astop to their tower—and its arrogance—by scrambling their shared language. Inthe ensuing miscommunication, the humans began to disagree, the buildinghalted, the people scattered, and the tower crumbled. In the Sumerian version ofthe same story, a god named Enki, jealous about humans’ fondness for anothergod, Enlil, cursed humans with many languages.A language superlearner could embrace this curse of disparate languages andwhisper in its ear, “Babel, no more.”Every adult of normal intelligence on the planet, about six billion people, haslearned at least one language as a child. A sizable (though uncounted and,interestingly, uncountable) number also speak an extra tongue. In some places,many individuals speak four or five languages they learned, even as adults. Butthat’s not the sort of person I have in mind.I’m talking about those rumored language superlearners, glimpsed here andthere, widely separated in time and space. Some, like Mithridates, lived half inlegend; some, like Giuseppe Mezzofanti, lived in a bygone age. Somesupposedly live among us right now. They are “hyperpolyglots.” Some canspeak or read to varying degrees in many dozens of languages. According to onedefinition, a hyperpolyglot is someone who speaks (or can use in reading,writing, or translating) at least six languages; this is the definition around whichI built my early investigations. Later I found that eleven languages may be amore accurate cutoff.I was originally drawn to hyperpolyglots for the way they reflect and refractideas about language, literacy, and aspirations about language learning andcultural capital in the modern world: who has it, who wants it, who gets it. It’seasy to find someone with a ready anecdote about an uncle, a high schoolprofessor, or someone met on an airplane who speaks a lot of languages or whocan learn them very easily. “Picks them up,” it’s said, as if languages had handlesor could fit into vacuum cleaner hoses. Because we know how hard it is to learneven one foreign language, we receive the tales with awe. Then we repeat themwith a skepticism or wonder that we save for stories about saints, healers, andprodigious lovers.At the outset, all I had were such stories, the tantalizing tales told over thecenturies about people with remarkable linguistic gifts. Most of the stories arelegends, unreliable as wholes. Yet hidden in them are kernels of truth that aresubject to discovery, assessment, and testing, which in turn can guide furtherexploration. Do such language superlearners really exist? How many are outthere, and what are they like? What could this gift for learning languages amountto, if it’s real? And what are the upper limits of our ability to learn, remember,and speak languages?Babel No More is an account of my search for solid answers to these and otherquestions. I decided to write as a curious adventurer rather than as a scholar,seeking the freedom to move across intellectual borders. Because this journeyhad no predestined end, I couldn’t write as if I knew what I’d find. I drew onpublished research literature, my interviews with scientists, my investigation inhistorical archives, memoirs by—and, of course, my interviews with—hyperpolyglots. An invaluable amount of information was gathered via an onlinesurvey of people who say they know six languages or more. All this wasnecessary to see why these souls have escaped the curse of the gods—and whatthe gods might have demanded of them in return. Would the secret of speakingmany languages provide a key to the secret of speaking any language at all?During my explorations, I grappled with the question of how best to makesense of what hyperpolyglots do in their lives with their languages. Whosestandards would I use to judge their abilities, if indeed those need to be judged? Ialso had to confront why language scientists have refused to considerhyperpolyglots, talented language learners, and language accumulators asanything more than curiosities or freaks. For instance, Carol Myers-Scotton, alinguist who is an expert on bilingualism, recommended in one of her books,“When you meet people who tell you they speak four or five languages, givethem a smile to show you’re impressed, but don’t take this claim very seriously.”I’m not exaggerating when I say that no one has critically looked at people whohave learned as many languages as hyperpolyglots claim, though scientists havestudied people who have learned one or two “second” or “foreign” languagesvery well. They prefer one kind of talent over another because of an obsessionwith native-likeness as the sole goal of language learning and an assumption thatthe native speaker is the sole model of success as a linguistic insider. Over andover I was told, sure, someone could learn the vocabularies of many languages,but no one could learn many languages at a native level. But, I wondered, couldthey be fluent in many languages? How fluent? What are the limits? These arequestions that motivated me.On my way, I’d have my own brain scanned. I’d make a fool of myself—andhave fun doing it—in Hindi, Italian, Spanish, and some other languages. I’d alsotravel the world, from Europe to the United States to India to Mexico, talking topeople who, one way or another, are making their way through Babel. Trackingdown experts and rooting out facts and theories from scientific publicationsdidn’t prepare me for the amazing specimens I’d meet. Some hyperpolyglots arehuman sponges, able to absorb or inhale languages unbelievably quickly. Othersare human cranes who can lift many languages at once. Still others are humanslingshots, using their experience in a few languages to fling them further.These aren’t geniuses, but they do possess unusual neurological resources.They have a penchant for conspicuous consumption of time and brainpower thatappears to be linked to the brains they possess. What makes them who they are isnot merely genetic; they’re influenced by the same trends as the rest of us.They’re choosing the same languages most people would. And they’re usingthem for the same purposes. Their personalities defy generalization—I didn’tfind it necessary to mistrust them as crippled egos who require the salve ofattention. Nor did I dance too often with their veracity. A healthy skepticism gotme through, in particular because I didn’t profile in depth anyone with afinancial interest in hyping their abilities.By the end of my journey, I realized that hyperpolyglots are avatars of what Icall the “will to plasticity.” This is the belief that we can, if we so wish, reshapeour brains—and that the world impels us to do so. Two quick examples of theimpetus for high-intensity language learning should suffice. “I want to be apolyglot,” someone posted on Twitter; I asked him why. “Because I want to beable to go anywhere and be able to communicate with anyone,” he replied. Thenthere was a news story extolling ten-year-old Arpan Sharma, a British boy whosupposedly speaks eleven languages, who explained that “When I’m an adult . . .I want to be a surgeon who can work in all the hospitals of the world and speakthe language of the country I’m in.” Whether you have learned one additionallanguage or a dozen, you have emulated this same desire. I hope I’m notglorifying them too much by saying that the hyperpolyglot makes visible themyriad strands of our linguistic destinies, whether we speak only one languageor many.Some of these strands and destinies take shape in the group of people whoform what I call a neural tribe. They’ve developed along neurological pathsdistinct from the rest of us, journeys that have given them a sense of mission andpersonal identity as language learners.Linguistically, they’re out of time, place, and scale. Could they be anadvanced specimen of the species? It’s tempting to think so. They are not born;they are not made; but they are born to be made. We’d need more advancedneuroscience to explore the nuances of the linguistic brain. I hope to be aroundto see it.It’s an odd tribe—there is no unified voice, no leaders, and no rules. In manyways, it’s a lost tribe, belonging to no nation. Yet, their dislocations seemreminiscent of everyone else’s. They have something to tell us about what ourbrains can do and what we must do to make our peace with Babel.
